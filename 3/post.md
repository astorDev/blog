Are you a C# rebel? üî•

While writing the previous post, I found myself diving into the fascinating world of C# records, which triggered an old thought of mine. Records could be single-line. Should you still create a file just for them?

And it's not just about records. What about extension methods you create for your own interface or for dependency injection? In general, I've found myself much more productive when I don't need to switch files constantly while working on a single feature. Surprisingly enough, I discovered that there's no such convention in other modern languages (except for Java, perhaps).

However, while surfing the web, I realized that a single class per file seems to be the default convention for C# nowadays. And for a team project, we'll need to follow a common convention. But what about personal projects? Do you still use the single class per file convention? Vote in the poll below!

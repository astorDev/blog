# C# : A minimalistic approach

I'm a C# enthusiast, but I'm also an all-around minimalist. Which sounds a little bit paradoxical, knowing that C# has never been a minimalistic language. It is not considered good for quick prototyping or scripting. Gladly, there's a shift in the latest language versions. In this article I'll cover what has already changed and what can be done to make C# even more minimalistic.

## Records and multilple types per file :page_facing_up:

Records are a new type in C# 9.0. They are immutable by default and have value semantics. They are also a great way to define a data structure. Let's compare the old and new ways of defining a data structure:

```csharp
// Old way
public class Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; init; }
    public string LastName { get; init; }
    public int Age { get; init; }

    public Person(string firstName, string lastName, int age)
    {
        FirstName = firstName;
        LastName = lastName;
        Age = age;
    }
}

// New way
public record Person(string FirstName, string LastName, int Age);
```

As you may see, the new way is much more concise. With a type so small the old notion of having only one class per file is heavily attacked. And although it seems that people still tend to separate types into different files, the paragigm is shifting. I personally, found that having to put a single type into a separate file is a little bit annoying. And I'm happy to see that convention being challenged more often now. Constantly switching from file to file prevents a developer from seeing the whole picture and sometimes decreases development speed drastically because of the context switching. So I'd always want to find a new way to structure my code as a minimalist.

## Top-level statements and Implicit usings :rocket:

Top-level statements are another new feature in C# 9. That allowed us to have a single file starting straight from the code statements, without a need of a class of method. This file serves as a project entry point. It's a great way to quickly prototype something or write a script. It's also a great way to get rid of the boilerplate code. C# 10 further simplified this with Implicit usings. Let's compare the old and new ways of writing a simple "Hello World" program:

```csharp
// Old way
using System;

namespace CSharp10
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```

```csharp
// New way
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```

As you may see, that is a huge improvement. And it's not only about the number of lines. It's also about the number of concepts. The old way required us to understand namespaces, classes, methods, and their modifiers. The new way is much more straightforward.

## A note about namespaces :alien:

That's important to know that with top level statements you can have an program class. It's needed for example for ASP.NET Integration testing. This is done by placing the following code after the top-level statements:

```csharp
public partial class Program {}
```

But what namespace is it in? Is it somehow inferred from the project name? Turns out it's not in any namespace! Wait... Is it legal? Surprisingly enough, it is! What's even more shocking is that it was legal virtually from the beginning of C#! And without a namespace, the class is just visible without any `using`.

What I still don't understand is: Why isn't it common practice to have classes without namespaces? I get why you'll want to skip, this for a public API. But here's an extensive list of places where you may use it:
- **ASP.NET Controllers** - you hardly will reference it somewhere. Why would you need a namespaces
- **Tests** - We can just group them by project name. Why declare a namespace?
- **Domain Layer** - Let's be honest the layer most likely will be used in a single solution where it's unlikely to have classes with the same name. So why overhead!

Unfortunately, I don't see a lot of discussion about the justification of having namespaces for every class in C#. So, maybe the article will be the spark.

## Kill the .csproj? :fire:

Top-level statements are a great leap towards making C# great for scripting and prototyping. But there's still a long way to go. And I feel like the main blocker is the necessity for a **csproj** file for any C# program. So, let's fantasize about how we can get rid of it in this post. I'll focus on solutions where we persist all the information csproj files contain but in the project's entry point file - `Program.cs` file instead. Here are my two ideas:

### 1. C# code in a compiler directive

```csharp
#csproj

project.Sdk = "Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web";
project.TargetFramework = "net8.0";
project.NullableEnabled = true;
project.ImplicitUsingsEnabled = true;
project.ProjectReferences.Add("../domain");
project.ProjectReferences.Add("../data");
project.PackageReferences.Add("Newtonsoft.Json:13.0.3");

#csproj

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");

app.Run();
```

What I like about the solution is that we'll utilize standard C# syntax here and drop the outdated XML format. It may also allow us to set the parameters in a strongly-typed fashion. However, it may be a bit tricky to parse the file for the compiler and IDEs. It will require very specific IntelliSense support. Also, it may be a little bit complicated to explain to the newcomers. But from the learning curve perspective, it seems similar to the already accepted top-level statements with their `args` variables.

### 2. Using a special comment

```csharp

/*csproj
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

  <ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="..\domain" />
  </ItemGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.3" />
  </ItemGroup>

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
*/

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");

app.Run();
```

That seems to have a lower learning curve and is easier to implement. But it continues the wrong bet on the XML format, which is losing its popularity and for a good reason: it's clunky and verbose.

## Conclusion :tada:

We are seeing a trends towards making C# minimalistic language. C# 9 and 10 are a great example of that. It's a great step towards making C# a better language for scripting and prototyping. But there's still a long way to go. Few problems lays in a conventional level: One file per type declaration convention and the convention of always having a namespaces for the type. I hope that article will be a spark of discussions around the conventions. And there's an technical problem of needing a **csproj** file. I've proposed two solutions to get rid of it. I hope that one day we'll see one of them or any other solution implemented. Let me know what you think in the comment below.
